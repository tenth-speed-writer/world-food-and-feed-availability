# World Food & Feed Availability

This project is a demonstration of data cleaning, tidying, and preparation skills - including the dplyr and tidyr packages.

For specific examples, see the README.md files in food_feed/ and population/

## Data & Preparation

The goal of our final preparation step - the others being outlined in the README files in their respective directories - shall be to integrate the prepared data from our two sources.

Both our food availability and population data are sorted by country and, more importantly, indexed by UN country codes. This gives us a definitive JOIN field, and in the same sequence of code, allows us to calculate per-capita availability - an equally, perhaps even more useful value.
